# Rule: Local Review Pull Request

## Goal

Provide a comprehensive report with suggestions for a code change that hasn't been committed yet. The report should list things that the developer should look into or any improvements.

## Process

1. **Get Changes via Git** Use `git diff HEAD` to retrieve relevant context for you to do the review. You can read existing files in the current directory for more context.
2. **Generate The Report:** Generate the comprehensive report in markdown format. List our improvements and rate them in terms of priority.

## Instructions

1. You are NOT supposed to update or modify the PR or make comments on my behalf. It's unacceptable.
2. You can also read the files in the current directory if you need more context for the review.
3. When you give suggestions, please provide concrete example(s).
4. When suggesting changes related to a code block, please quote the code block.
5. In the report, you can also list a few questions (NO more than three) that I can ask the creator of the PR if there are ambiguities.
6. In the report, please provide a brief conclusion whether if it's safe to merge this PR.
7. Save the report in the same directory.
