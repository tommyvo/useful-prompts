# Review GitHub Pull Request

Review a GitHub Pull Request using the `gh` CLI tool and provide a comprehensive report with suggestions.

**Instructions:**

1. If I provide a PR number, use it directly: `gh pr view <number>`
2. If I don't provide a PR number, infer it from the current branch: `gh pr view --json number -q .number`
3. Use read-only `gh` commands to gather context (NEVER modify the PR):
   - `gh pr view <number>` - Get PR details
   - `gh pr diff <number>` - Get code changes
   - `gh pr checks <number>` - Get CI/CD status
4. Read relevant files in the workspace for additional context
5. Provide the review report directly in the chat (do NOT create files)

**Review Focus Areas (in priority order):**

1. üî¥ Correctness - Logic errors, bugs, edge cases
2. üü† Security - Vulnerabilities, unsafe practices
3. üü° Code Quality - Clarity, maintainability, best practices
4. üü¢ Style - Consistency, formatting, naming conventions

**Response Guidelines:**

- Use concrete examples with code snippets
- Quote the original code when suggesting changes
- Provide suggested fixes using unified diff format (see below)
- Include up to 3 questions for the PR author if clarification is needed
- Conclude with a merge recommendation (Safe to merge / Needs changes / Blocking issues)

## Unified Diff Format

When suggesting code changes, use unified diff format:

**Rules:**

- Include the file paths: `--- path/to/file` and `+++ path/to/file` (no timestamps or prefixes)
- Start each hunk with `@@` line indicating line numbers
- Mark removed lines with `-` prefix
- Mark added/new lines with `+` prefix
- Preserve exact indentation and spacing
- Include complete code blocks when editing functions/methods
- To move code: use 2 hunks (1 to delete, 1 to insert)
- To create new files: use `--- /dev/null` to `+++ path/to/new/file`

**Example:**

```diff
--- src/example.js
+++ src/example.js
@@ -10,3 +10,3 @@
 function calculate(x, y) {
-  return x + y;
+  return x * y;
 }
```

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Inconsistent Error Handling
**Priority:** üü† HIGH

Multiple files need consistent error handling:

**File:** `src/api.js`
```diff
[diff here]
```

**File:** `src/utils.js`
```diff
[diff here]
```

## Questions for PR Author

1. [Question about unclear logic or missing context]
2. [Question about architectural decision]
3. [Question about test coverage]

## Conclusion

**Recommendation:** [Safe to merge ‚úÖ | Needs changes ‚ö†Ô∏è | Blocking issues ‚ùå]

**Summary:** [Brief summary of overall assessment]

## Priority Levels

Use emoji color-coding for priorities:
- üü£ CRITICAL - Must fix before merge (security, data loss, breaking changes)
- üî¥ SHOULD FIX - Important issues (bugs, logic errors, significant problems)
- üü° MEDIUM - Improvements recommended (code quality, maintainability)
- üü¢ LOW - Nice to have (style, minor optimizations, suggestions)
