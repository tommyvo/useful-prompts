# Local Code Review

## Goal

Provide a comprehensive report with suggestions for a code change that hasn't been committed yet. The report should list things that the developer should review, any optimizations that can be applied, and any security concerns.

## Process

1. **Get Changes via Git, VERY IMPORTANT MUST DO! DO NOT SKIP!!!!!!!!** Use `git diff HEAD` to retrieve relevant context for you to do the review. You can read existing files in the current directory for more context.
2. **Generate The Report:** Generate the comprehensive report in markdown format. List our improvements and rate them in terms of priority.
3. **Apply Appropriate Fixes:** After generating the report, automatically apply any suggestions that are appropriate. Appropriate fixes are those that: (1) are in scope of the changes being made, and (2) would improve security, readability, fix obvious bugs, or address style/lint issues. Skip suggestions that don't relate to the changes being made or would require significant architectural decisions. **IMPORTANT:** If you decide to not apply any of the suggested changes, please highlight the ones that were skipped and explain why. Please do not save the report in the filesystem. You should only output to chat.

## Instructions

1. After generating the code review report, you will apply appropriate changes as described in the "What to do after" section below.
2. **Before applying changes, create a todo list** of all the suggestions that will be automatically applied, so the user can track the progress.
3. You can also read the files in the current directory if you need more context for the review.
4. When you give suggestions, please provide concrete example(s).
5. When suggesting changes related to a code block, please quote the code block.
6. In the report, you can also list a few questions if there are ambiguities.
7. In the report, please provide a brief conclusion whether if it's safe to merge this PR.
8. **Only include files in the report that have specific suggestions or issues.** Do not create sections for files that look good with no changes needed.

## What to Review

1. Correctness (high priority)
2. Security
3. Code clarity
4. Reusability
5. Consistency (low priority)

## Audience

1. The audience of this report is the PR reviewer. Please make sure it's easy to follow. Usually, the reviewer also doesn't have all the context.
2. Use emoji color-coding for priority levels:
   - ðŸŸ£ SHOULD FIX (purple) - Critical issues that must be addressed
   - ðŸ”´ HIGH (red) - Important issues that should be addressed
   - ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM (yellow) - Nice-to-have improvements
   - ðŸŸ¢ LOW (green) - Minor suggestions or style preferences

## Output

Output the report in Chat as markdown. You can use four backticks (````) for the outer markdown fenced code block, and three backticks for any fenced code blocks within the markdown.

## Report Format

The report should follow this format:

````markdown
